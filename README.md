# novel-dialogue-formatter
 A program to help organize character dialogue in proper format.

 # Background
 I have always been fascinated by a good story, novels in particular. I tried to write one or two when I was a teenager,
 but I got lost in the dialogue. The goal of this project is to create a way for people to share their stories without 
 getting bogged down by the minute details of writing dialogue.

 This is a project I am creating in my spare time, but the proposed tasks are as follows:
 - Create simple functionality in node that takes dialogue as input, along with the character saying it, and translates it 
    to basic dialogue format.
 - Create a React app that utilizes the dialogue generation functionality.
 - Expand the functionality of the app to include templating for more complex dialogue formatting.
